# BLOG-API
This repo is to host the blog API that I built for the trial project for internship at Masko

# This can also be used as a boiler plate for an API to server blogs
- User session is maintained using cookies

# How to run the app?
```
$npm i
$npm run dev
```

# TODO
- Add documentation to use the boiler plate
